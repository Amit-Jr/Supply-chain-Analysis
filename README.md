# Supply-chain-Analysis
Problem Statement - Product Shipment Weight
  Business Problem:


A FMCG company has entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has notices that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and where the demand is low, supply is pretty high. In both the ways it is an inventory cost loss to the company; hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in entire country.


Goal & Objective: The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse. Also try to analysis the demand pattern in different pockets of the country so management can drive the advertisement campaign particular in those pockets.
This is the first phase of the agreement; hence, company has shared very limited information. Once you are able to showcase a tangible impact with this much of information then company will open the 360 degree data lake for your consulting company to build a more robust model.
